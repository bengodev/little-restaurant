**Simplified step-by-step explanation** of how Django app **gets real-time updates** from the PostgreSQL database and pushes them to the **browser via WebSocket**.

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Data Push Flow (Simplified)

### 🔧 1. **PostgreSQL Trigger**

You set up a **trigger** on your database table (e.g. `chat_message`) that watches for changes like **new rows added**.

> Think of it like:
>
> > “Whenever a new message is saved to this table, let me know!”

✅ **What happens:**
PostgreSQL runs a trigger function that calls `NOTIFY 'new_message'` with the new data.

---

### 🧏‍♂️ 2. **`listen_notify` Management Command**

You create a Django management command like:

```bash
python manage.py listen_forever
```

This command:

* **Connects to your PostgreSQL database**
* Listens for `NOTIFY` events on the channel (e.g. `new_message`)
* Gets the data sent by the trigger

✅ **What happens:**
When it hears a change, it grabs the message and forwards it.

---

### 🚀 3. **Send Message via Redis (Channels Layer)**

Once the command receives the update, it:

* Sends the message to Django Channels (ASGI)
* Uses **Redis as the communication bridge** between your processes

✅ **What happens:**
The message is routed to the right **WebSocket consumer** (connected users).

---

### 🌐 4. **Daphne + Django Consumer**

Your **Daphne** server runs the Django ASGI app.
It:

* Handles WebSocket connections
* Receives the message from Redis
* Sends it to the browser via WebSocket

✅ **What happens:**
The browser gets a push notification instantly.

---

### 🖥️ 5. **Browser Reaction**

The frontend JavaScript code:

* Listens to the WebSocket
* When a new message arrives:

  * Logs it in the console
  * Plays a sound (if you want)

✅ **What happens:**
You see or hear the new update **in real-time**, no page refresh!
